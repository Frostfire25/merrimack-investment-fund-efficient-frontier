# Portfolio Optimization with Efficient Frontier

This Streamlit application allows users to input a portfolio of stock tickers, select custom portfolio weights via interactive sliders, and visualize the portfolio's performance on the Efficient Frontier. The app provides insights into risk and return trade-offs and helps users find optimal portfolio allocations.

## Features

- **Input Stock Tickers**: Users can enter a list of stock symbols (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, TSLA) to analyze.
- **Adjust Portfolio Weights**: Dynamic sliders allow users to specify the weight of each stock in the portfolio.
- **Efficient Frontier Calculation**: The app computes the Efficient Frontier, which is a set of optimal portfolios that provide the best possible return for a given level of risk.
- **Custom Portfolio Comparison**: Users can compare their custom portfolio to the Efficient Frontier.
- **Interactive Visualization**: The results are displayed on an interactive graph using Plotly, where the Efficient Frontier and the custom portfolio are plotted.

## Requirements

The following Python packages are required to run the app:

- `streamlit`
- `yfinance`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scipy`
- `plotly`

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install streamlit yfinance numpy pandas scipy plotly
```

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the Application

To start the Streamlit application, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run portfolio_optimizer.py
```

This will start a local web server and open the app in your browser.

### Step 4: Use the App

1. **Enter Tickers**: Input a list of stock tickers (comma-separated) into the text box. For example: `AAPL, MSFT, TSLA`.
2. **Set Date Range**: Specify the start and end dates for historical data fetching.
3. **Adjust Weights**: Use the sliders to assign weights to each stock in your portfolio. The total weight will be automatically normalized to sum to 1.
4. **Update Portfolio**: Click the "Update Portfolio" button to calculate the Efficient Frontier and see how your custom portfolio compares.
5. **View Results**: The plot will display the Efficient Frontier and highlight your custom portfolio with its corresponding risk and return.

## Example

Here’s a quick example of how to use the app:

- Input the tickers `AAPL, MSFT, TSLA` in the ticker field.
- Set the portfolio weights using the sliders (e.g., 40% AAPL, 30% MSFT, 30% TSLA).
- Click "Update Portfolio" to visualize the portfolio’s performance against the Efficient Frontier.
